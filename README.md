### 👋 Hey, I'm Anwesha

</div>

I’m a computer science student passionate about systems, AI, and building things that actually ship. Most of my time goes into operating systems, CPU scheduling, AI/ML-powered tools, and hardware–software integration.

🌱 Currently learning: OS internals, networks, DBMS, and digital logic

🧪 Working on: energy‑aware CPU schedulers, reconfigurable hardware, and accessibility‑focused AI projects

💻 Love building: end‑to‑end apps (backend, frontend, and a bit of embedded) that solve real problems

🤝 Open to: research collaborations, hackathons, and impactful student projects

🔭 What I’m Building
OS simulators for smarter, energy‑aware scheduling

AI chatbots for legal rights and financial awareness for teens and young users

Accessibility projects like image–audio captioning systems and IoT‑based smart inventory/monitoring tools
